# Hardware – Arduino
## Required Components
- **NodeMCU ESP-32** 
- **HX711** 
- **LCD module**  
- **Load cell**  
*(For a detailed list of components, refer to the BOM file.)*
## Setup Instructions
### 1. Hardware Connections
Connect the components as shown in the diagram below:  
![Hardware Connections](https://github.com/iiot-4/Smart-Factory-Quality-Monitoring-System/blob/main/Aruduino%20%26%20MQTT/Fig1_v2-removebg-preview.png)
- For the HX711 connections:
- The DT pin (data) connects to ESP32 digital pin 16.
- The SCK pin (clock) connects to ESP32 digital pin 17.
- The NodeMCU ESP32 serves as the main processing unit. It reads the data from the HX711, processes the weight information, displays it on the LCD, and uses Wi-Fi to send data via MQTT communication.
- The LCD module displays the measured weight and communicates with the ESP32 using the I2C protocol, which requires two connections:
- The SDA pin (serial data) connects to ESP32 GPIO21.
- The SCL pin (serial clock) connects to ESP32 GPIO22.

# Software – AWS Cloud
## Local machine
1. Program File:
   - Create a connect_AWS.py on local to send data to AWS Cloud's IoT SiteWise.
2. Install Necessary Packages:
   - Ensure you have installed AWS SDK for Python (boto3) and other required Python packages like pandas.
   - Installation command: `pip install boto3`
3. Configure AWS IAM Credentials:
   - In the connect_AWS.py, enter the Access_key and Secret_key provided by AWS Cloud to establish a secure connection with AWS.
4. Sending Data:
   - In the connect_AWS.py, set the data format to be sent to IoT SiteWise, such as measurements (e.g., weight).
   - The connect_AWS.py will send data to AWS at specified intervals.
## AWS Cloud
1. IAM User Setup:
   - Log in to the AWS Management Console and go to the IAM service.
   - Create a new IAM user.
   - Generate Access Key and Secret Key for the user, which will be used for the local script’s connection configuration.
   - In the Set permissions step, select Attach policies directly and grant full access to AWS SiteWise operations and AWS GRAFANA's write and read permissions.
    ![Figure 1](https://github.com/iiot-4/Smart-Factory-Quality-Monitoring-System/blob/main/AWS%20Cloud/Fig%201.png)
2. IoT SiteWise: Creating Asset Models and Assets:
   - Go to the IoT SiteWise service, click Models, and create a new model:
     - Name it WeightModel.
     - Add the following two types of definitions to the model:
       - Attribute Definitions: Used to record static properties (such as device name or specifications).
       - Measurement Definitions: Used to receive measurement data (such as weight data).
      ![Figure 2](https://github.com/iiot-4/Smart-Factory-Quality-Monitoring-System/blob/main/AWS%20Cloud/Fig%202.png)
      ![Figure 3](https://github.com/iiot-4/Smart-Factory-Quality-Monitoring-System/blob/main/AWS%20Cloud/Fig%203.png)
   - Based on the WeightModel just created, add an asset:
     - Asset name: Weight1.
     - During the addition process, specify the Measurement alias (`/factory/Weight_test/Weight`) for data transmission and retrieval.
       ![Figure 4](https://github.com/iiot-4/Smart-Factory-Quality-Monitoring-System/blob/main/AWS%20Cloud/Fig%204.png)
       ![Figure 5](https://github.com/iiot-4/Smart-Factory-Quality-Monitoring-System/blob/main/AWS%20Cloud/Fig%205.png)

   - After completion, verify the asset page. You can execute connect_AWS.py locally to check if the transmitted data appears in the Latest value and Latest value timestamp fields.
     ![Figure 6](https://github.com/iiot-4/Smart-Factory-Quality-Monitoring-System/blob/main/AWS%20Cloud/Fig%206.png)
## Amazon Managed Grafana

# Calibration and Program Execution
1. **Connect the device**  
Plug the ESP-32 into your computer via USB.
2. **Select board and port**  
- In the Arduino IDE, select the board type:  
  ```
  Tools -> Board -> esp32 -> NodeMCU-32S
  ```
- Select the correct port (viewable in **Device Manager**).
3. **Run calibration**  
- Open and upload the **HX711_Calibration** program.  
- Prepare a test object with a known weight (e.g., a calibration weight).  
- Modify the `sample_weight` variable to match the object's actual weight.  
- Follow the on-screen instructions to calibrate and note the calibration value displayed.  
4. **Run the MQTT script**  
- Open the `connect_AWS.py` script and modify the following variables:  
  - `MQTT_BROKER`: Set it to your MQTT broker's IPv4 address.  
  - `MQTT_TOPIC`: Set it to your desired MQTT topic.  
- Run the script.
5. **Run the main program**  
- Open the `Final_code` program in the Arduino IDE and modify:  
  - `scale_factor`: Replace with the calibration value obtained earlier.  
  - `ssid`: Set your WiFi network ID.  
  - `Password`: Set your WiFi password.  
  - `mqttServer`: Set the broker's IPv4 address.  
  - `mqttTopic`: Set your desired MQTT topic.  
- Upload the program to the ESP-32.
6. Log in to AWS SiteWise and confirm that the Measurements field in the Weight1 asset displays the latest data and timestamp.
7. Log in to Grafana and confirm that the dashboard displays the transmitted data in real-time.
   ![Figure 12](https://github.com/iiot-4/Smart-Factory-Quality-Monitoring-System/blob/main/AWS%20Cloud/Fig%2012.png)
## System Functionality
- The system transmits weight data via MQTT every **10 seconds** to an AWS database for analysis.  
- Every **15 seconds**, the system prompts the user to replace the measured object for continuous monitoring.
